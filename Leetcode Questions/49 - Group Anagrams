This code does not produce duplicate values in the key-value pair because it uses a dictionary to store the anagram groups. In Python, a dictionary is a collection of key-value pairs, where each key is unique. When a new key-value pair is added to a dictionary, if the key already exists, the value associated with that key is updated with the new value. Therefore, in this code, when a new anagram is found, it is added to the list of strings associated with the key that represents its sorted characters. If the key already exists, the new string is simply appended to the existing list of strings. This ensures that each key in the dictionary is unique and that there are no duplicate values associated with any key.
