# Leet.Code Study Repository

This repository contains my solutions and notes for problems I've solved on LeetCode. It serves as a personal record and a way to track my progress in algorithmic problem solving and data structures.

## Structure

Each problem has its own directory, named after the problem's title on LeetCode. Inside each directory, you'll find the following:

- A `solution` file containing my solution to the problem.
- A `notes` file where I jot down my thoughts, the approach I took, and any interesting things I learned while solving the problem.

## Usage

Feel free to explore and reference this repository. If you find something useful or learn something new, that's great!

Please note that these are my personal solutions and they may not be the most optimal or efficient. Always refer to the LeetCode discussions for a wide range of solutions and explanations.
